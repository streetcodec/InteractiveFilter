# Interactive Filter


This is an interactive face filter made using unity game engine, aimed to be an open source alternative to snapchat and other face filter applications.

This app has a user friendly interface giving options of different frames and colors with multiple combinations.

Any developer can use their own creativity and make new and better filters, (importing new 3D Objects and combining them in various ways).

Also, UI can be improved in future, with addition of many more options and choices.

A sneak peak of current design:
